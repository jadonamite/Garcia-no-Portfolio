               I am a front-end developer based in Sydney looking for exciting
               opportunities. Has Mechanical Engineering background. Likes to
               focus on accessibility when developing. Passionate and curious
               about solving problems. Currently, Iâ€™m exploring Reactjs, Webflow
               and a bit of Designing. While I am not programming, I enjoy
               playing football, photography and playing Valorant. Learning more
               to improve skill.
